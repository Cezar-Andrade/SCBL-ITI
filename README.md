# Sistema de Control Bibliotecario en Linea - ITI (Online Library Control System - ITI)

This is a website made in HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript, the framework used to run this website is XAMPP 8.2.12 which includes "Apache 2.4.58, MariaDB 10.4.32, PHP 8.2.12, phpMyAdmin 5.2.1, OpenSSL 3.1.3, XAMPP Control Panel 3.2.4, Webalizer 2.23-04, Mercury Mail Transport System 4.63, FileZilla FTP Server 0.9.41, Tomcat 8.5.96 (with mod_proxy_ajp as connector), Strawberry Perl 5.32.1.1 Portable"

Despite the name implying to be online, the website was not built to be released online to the users due to change of plans internally, most stuff was being planned to be built for multiple users connecting to it with a logging system for users and admins, ultimatelly was discontinued and some stuff got also removed and changed to fit the needs at the time

It uses the following libraries which are already included in the project files since it was meant to work without the need for internet conection:
- QZ Tray for printing to a recepit printer through the navigator
- Selectize for adding comboboxes with multiple choices to HTML
- PHPSpreadsheet for creating Excel Spread Sheets for reports

As an additional note, you have to download and install Qz Tray program from their website, configure it properly so it functions well with the website and have it running on your computer while the website is running, for further information on that check their website and documentation for it: https://qz.io
